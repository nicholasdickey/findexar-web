          <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<h2>What is Findexar?</h2>
<p>Findexar is a media mention tracking tool focused on professional teams and athletes across major leagues like the NFL, NHL, MBA, and NBA.</p>
<p>Our advanced platform comprehensively scans both print and online media to identify and index every mention of athletes and teams. We go beyond just professional sports commentary, including general interest sections of leading newspapers and websites, to ensure thorough coverage of relevant mentions.</p>
<p>Typically, such in-depth information would cost thousands of dollars per month for professional teams, sports agents, and athletes, often acquired through large agencies like Nielsen. Findexar offers this invaluable service to a broader audience at a much lower cost. We provide not only links to media sources but also brief digests of the mention’s context and summaries of the articles, all powered by the premier AI technology in the industry – OpenAI's Large Language Model.</p>
<h2>Who is the Target Audience?</h2>
<p>Findexar is designed for Fantasy Sports enthusiasts who demand a robust media monitoring tool for tracking mentions of their chosen athletes. Our platform enables easy browsing for athlete mentions by team and name.</p>
<p>It is also a vital resource for any sports fan looking to stay informed, particularly those involved in sports betting.</p>
<h2>What are Findexar's features?</h2>
<h3>Browse by League, Team, and Athlete</h3>
<p>You can go directly to the level of specificity you are looking for by selecting the league, team, or athlete to review the mentions.</p>
<h3>Review the Combined Mentions Feed</h3>
<p>If you stay at the top level, or the league level, you can jump off to an athlete's or team's section by clicking on a mention.</p> 
<h3>Favorites</h3>
<p>Click on a star on a mention to add the mention to the Favorites collection.</p>
<h4>My Team</h4>
<p>When in the team area, click on the icon to the right of the athlete's name to add them to the My Team collection. Use the My Team checkbox to filter mentions by My Team when at the top or league levels.</p>
<h2>How does Findexar work?</h2>
<p>Suffice it to say, we use AI to create digests for the article with athletes or teams mentions. Then, for every mention in the article, we create a short mention gist, to give you an idea of the nature and context of each mention, as much as possible. </p>
<h2>Are there any social media accounts to follow Findexar on?</h2>
<p>Yes, to contact us use X (aka Twitter) <a href="https://twitter.com/findexar/">@findexar</a>.</p>
<p>We also use the following X accounts for full league digests:</p>
<p>NFL: <a href="https://twitter.com/nflpress_digest">@nflpress_digest</a></p>
<p>NHL: <a href="https://twitter.com/nhl_digest">@nhl_digest</a></p>
<p>MLB: <a href="https://twitter.com/mlb_digest">@mlb_digest</a></p>
<p>NBA: <a href="https://twitter.com/nba_digest">@nba_digest</a></p>
<h2>What is the cost?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, AI technology doesn't come free or cheap. We have to charge a monthly subscription fee to provide such a service. It is $10 per month or $100 per year. Compared to the thousands paid monthly by teams, agents, and athletes for more primitive services provided by traditional manual media monitors, it is a rock-bottom price.</p>
<p>You can explore the platform for three days for free and without any obligations or entering credit card information. But you will need to create a free account to explore all the features.</p>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>As the product grows and AI technology matures, we will be adding full video mentions and will experiment with AI-based prediction ability, based on the data we collect. Join us on this journey!</p>
